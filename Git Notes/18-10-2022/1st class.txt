Source Code Management (SCM)  To store our projet code 
GitHub, Gitlab , BitBucket depends on our project requirements.

Github  it is a collection of repositories which are used to store our code.
git  it is a git client software which helps us to configure repositories, managing the code using git.


Local machine  
Dev-1 -- code -- feature-1 -- stored locally..!  
Dev-2 -- code -- feature-2 -- stored locally..!

remote repo
- code is storing in a centralized way
- code sharing(distribution) is easy 
- storing code in a safe and secure place
- code tracking
- versioning
- phased manner deployment v1, v2
